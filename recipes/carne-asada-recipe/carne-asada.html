    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>A juicy and flavorful carne asada starts with a delicious carne asada marinade.
         This recipe begins with a 24-hour marinade to allow the flank steak to soak up all the tasty and fresh flavors before grilling.</p>
    <p>Whether you serve it as tacos, a salad topping, or simply chow down on the tender, 
        flavor-packed steak by itself, this will be the best carne asada you've ever experienced.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Fruit Juice</strong>: ¾ cup orange juice, ½ cup lemon juice, ⅓ cup lime juice</li>
        <li><strong>Soy Sauce</strong>: ½ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li><strong>Seasonings and Spices</strong>: 1 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped, 4 cloves garlic, minced, 1 tablespoon chili powder, 1 tablespoon ground cumin,
            1 tablespoon ground paprika, 1 tablespoon ground black pepper, 1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li><strong>Chipotle Pepper</strong>: 1 teaspoon finely chopped canned chipotle pepper</li>
        <li><strong>Olive Oil</strong>: ½ cup olive oil</li>
        <li><strong>Carne Asada</strong>: 3 pounds flank steak</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine orange juice, lemon juice, and lime juice for marinade in a large glass or ceramic bowl. 
            Add cilantro, soy sauce, garlic, chili powder, cumin, paprika, black pepper, 
            chipotle pepper, and oregano; stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Slowly whisk in olive oil until well combined. Remove 1 cup of the marinade and place in a small bowl;
            cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for use after the steak is cooked.</li>
        <li>Place steak between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. 
            Firmly pound steak with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/4 inch.</li>
        <li>After pounding, poke steak all over with a fork. Place steak in the marinade in the large bowl, cover, and marinate in the refrigerator for 24 hours.</li>
        <li>When ready to cook, preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Remove steak from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade.</li>
        <li>Cook steak on the preheated grill to desired doneness, about 5 minutes per side for medium-rare.</li>
        <li>Remove steak from grill and slice across the grain.</li>
        <li>Place on a serving platter and pour the reserved, unused marinade over top. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
